Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 3D pipeline: modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion tracking, even video editing.

Development of Blender happens at [`projects.blender.org`](https://projects.blender.org/blender/blender) and is [funded](https://fund.blender.org) entirely by donations from entrepreneurs, companies, and users.

Here on GitHub we host read-only mirrors for some of our repositories. If you encounter any issues (e.g. with pulling Git LFS objects), please check the documentation [here](https://developer.blender.org/docs/handbook/contributing/using_git/#github-mirror).
